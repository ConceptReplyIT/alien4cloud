  Background:
    Given I am authenticated with "ADMIN" role
    And There are these users in the system
      | frodon |
    And I create a new group with name "hobbits" in the system
    And I create a new application with name "LAMP" and description "LAMP Stack application..." without errors

  @reset
  Scenario: Add role to user
    When I add a role "DEPLOYMENT_MANAGER" to user "frodon" on the resource type "ENVIRONMENT" named "Environment"
    Then I should receive a RestResponse with no error
    When I get the application environment named "Environment"
    And I register the rest response data as SPEL context of type "alien4cloud.model.application.ApplicationEnvironment"
    And The SPEL expression "userRoles['frodon'][0]" should return "DEPLOYMENT_MANAGER"

  @reset
  Scenario: Add then remove role to user
    Given I add a role "DEPLOYMENT_MANAGER" to user "frodon" on the resource type "ENVIRONMENT" named "Environment"
    When I remove a role "DEPLOYMENT_MANAGER" to user "frodon" on the resource type "ENVIRONMENT" named "Environment"
    Then I should receive a RestResponse with no error
    When I get the application environment named "Environment"
    And I register the rest response data as SPEL context of type "alien4cloud.model.application.ApplicationEnvironment"
    And The SPEL boolean expression "userRoles['frodon'] == null" should return true
