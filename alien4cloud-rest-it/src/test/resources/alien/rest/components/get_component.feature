  Background:
    Given I am authenticated with "COMPONENTS_BROWSER" role

  @reset
  Scenario: Query for a component
    Given I have a component with uuid "whatever:3.0"
    When I get the component with uuid "whatever:3.0"
    Then I should receive a RestResponse with no error
      And I should retrieve a component detail with list of it's properties and interfaces.

  Scenario: get a component other than a node type
    Given I am authenticated with "COMPONENTS_MANAGER" role
      And I already had a csar with name "myCsar" and version "1.0-SNAPSHOT"
      #And I add to the csar "myCsar" "1.0-SNAPSHOT" the component "rootNodeType"
      And I create "capabilities" in an archive name "myCsar" version "1.0-SNAPSHOT"
        |tosca.capabilities.Container|
        |tosca.capabilities.Feature|
        |fastconnect.capabilities.Runner|
    When I try to get a component with id "tosca.capabilities.Container:1.0-SNAPSHOT"
    Then I should receive a RestResponse with no error
      And I should have a component with id "tosca.capabilities.Container:1.0-SNAPSHOT"
