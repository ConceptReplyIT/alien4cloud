Feature: get runtime topology ubuntu type

  Background:
    Given I am authenticated with "ADMIN" role
    And I upload the archive "tosca-normative-types-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT"
    And I upload a plugin
    And I create an orchestrator named "Mount doom orchestrator" and plugin id "alien4cloud-mock-paas-provider:1.0" and bean name "mock-orchestrator-factory"
    And I enable the orchestrator "Mount doom orchestrator"
    And I create a location named "Thark location" and infrastructure type "OpenStack" to the orchestrator "Mount doom orchestrator"
    And I create a resource of type "alien.nodes.mock.openstack.Flavor" named "Medium" related to the location "Mount doom orchestrator"/"Thark location"
    And I update the property "id" to "2" for the resource named "Medium" related to the location "Mount doom orchestrator"/"Thark location"
    And I create a resource of type "alien.nodes.mock.openstack.Image" named "Ubuntu" related to the location "Mount doom orchestrator"/"Thark location"
    And I update the property "id" to "img1" for the resource named "Ubuntu" related to the location "Mount doom orchestrator"/"Thark location"
    And I autogenerate the on-demand resources for the location "Mount doom orchestrator"/"Thark location"
    And There are these users in the system
      | sangoku |
    And I add a role "APPLICATIONS_MANAGER" to user "sangoku"
    And I add a role "COMPONENTS_MANAGER" to user "sangoku"
    And I add a role "DEPLOYER" to user "sangoku" on the resource type "LOCATION" named "Mount doom cloud"
    And I am authenticated with user named "sangoku"
    And I upload the archive "tosca base types 1.0"
    And I should receive a RestResponse with no error
    And I upload the archive "sample apache lb types 0.1"
    And I should receive a RestResponse with no error
    And I upload the archive "ubuntu types 0.1"
    And I should receive a RestResponse with no error
    And I have an application "ALIEN" with a topology containing a nodeTemplate "apacheLBGroovy" related to "fastconnect.nodes.apacheLBGroovy:0.1"
    And I Set a unique location policy to "Mount doom orchestrator"/"Thark location" for all nodes
    And I have added a node template "Ubuntu" related to the "alien.nodes.Ubuntu:0.1" node type
    And I add a relationship of type "tosca.relationships.HostedOn" defined in archive "tosca-base-types" version "1.0" with source "apacheLBGroovy" and target "Ubuntu" for requirement "host" of type "tosca.capabilities.Container" and target capability "Ubuntu"

  Scenario: Getting the runtime version of the deployed topology
    Given I have deleted a node template "apacheLBGroovy" from the topology
    When I ask the runtime topology of the application "ALIEN" on the location "Thark location" of "Mount doom orchestrator"
    Then I should receive a RestResponse with no error
    And The RestResponse should contain a nodetemplate named "apacheLBGroovy" and type "fastconnect.nodes.apacheLBGroovy"
    And The RestResponse should contain a nodetemplate named "Ubuntu" and type "alien.nodes.Ubuntu"
    When I try to retrieve the created topology
    Then I should receive a RestResponse with no error
    And The RestResponse should contain a nodetemplate named "Ubuntu" and type "alien.nodes.Ubuntu"
    And The RestResponse should not contain a nodetemplate named "apacheLBGroovy"
